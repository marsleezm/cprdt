 * This class is for creating asynchronous periodic tasks.

 * Typically, this class will be used to create anonymous classes by overriding
 * run() to place the code to be executed at given times in the future.
 * 
 * Periodic tasks repeat execution with a given period (frequency) until
 * cancelled.
 * 
 * They can be re-scheduled (often within run()) to execute again at a later
 * time.
 * 
 * Periodic tasks can be cancelled to prevent them from executing any further.
