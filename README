=== Running scripts ===
Deployment scripts are written in Groovy.
The scripts are in scripts/groovy/deployment directory, both deployment classes
definitions (such as SwiftBase.groovy, SwiftSocial.groovy etc.) and concrete
experiment instances (runsocial.groovy etc.).

To run the scripts, you need:
(1) groovy and ant installed on your machine, and
(2) deployment keys, located in an archive on gforge, in your swiftcloud/
directory,
(3) groovy pointing out to scripts/groovy as the classpath.

For example, to run swiftsocial experiment, execute the following command:
groovy -cp scripts/groovy scripts/groovy/swift/deployment/runsocial.groovy
