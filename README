=== Running scripts ===
Deployment scripts are written in Groovy.
The scripts are in scripts/groovy/deployment directory, both deployment classes
definitions (such as SwiftBase.groovy, SwiftSocial.groovy etc.) and concrete
experiment instances (runsocial.groovy etc.).

To run the scripts, you need:
(1) groovy and ant installed on your machine, and
(2) ssh access configured for the target machine, typically EC2 (ask one of us
for the keys). The simplest is to configure your ssh like this:
Host *.compute.amazonaws.com
	StrictHostKeyChecking no
	UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
	IdentityFile PATH_TO_SSH_KEY_GOES_HERE

Host *.compute-1.amazonaws.com
	StrictHostKeyChecking no
	UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
	IdentityFile PATH_TO_SSH_KEY_GOES_HERE

To run experiments, use scripts from scripts/groovy/swift/deployment
E.g. to run swiftsocial:
./scripts/groovy/swift/deployment/runsocial.groovy

To generate plots, use scripts from scripts/groovy/swift/stats
E.g. to generate metadata overhead plots:
./scripts/groovy/swift/deployment/runsocial_metadata_overhead.groovy
